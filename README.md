# Grade-Calculator
An application, using a solution algorithm that uses logical and relational expressions, that calculates the percentage and final grade for students in a class. The application will prompt to enter the students first and last name, and the number of points the student received. The application only accepts scores between 0 and 1,000 points (including 0 and 1,000), with 1,000 points being the maximum number of points. If the input value is within the valid range, the program will display a  “good score” message; otherwise, the program will display an error message and then terminate the program. The program then  calculates the score percentage and then displays the student’s first name, last name, number of points, calculated percentage, and final grade.
